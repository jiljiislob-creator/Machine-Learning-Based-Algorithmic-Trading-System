# Machine Learning-Based Algorithmic Trading System

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a Python-based algorithmic trading system leveraging machine learning to predict stock market trends. The system uses a Random Forest Regressor to analyze historical stock data and make trading decisions. It exemplifies the integration of data science and finance, highlighting real-time data processing, historical data analysis, predictive modeling, and a basic framework for strategy backtesting.

## Features
- **Real-Time and Historical Data Processing:** Utilizes the Alpha Vantage API to fetch real-time and historical stock data.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Employs technical indicators as features for the machine learning model, enhancing prediction accuracy.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implements a Random Forest Regressor to forecast future stock prices.
- **Strategy Backtesting:** Includes a basic backtesting framework to evaluate the effectiveness of the trading strategy under historical market conditions.
- **Visualization:** Features data visualization tools to represent the model’s predictions and backtesting results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for the overall programming language.
- **Pandas and NumPy** for data handling and manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn** for implementing the machine learning model.
- **Alpha Vantage API** for accessing stock market data.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for visualizing data.
- **TA (Technical Analysis Library)** for computing technical indicators.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Obtain an API key from Alpha Vantage and configure it as per the instructions in the project.

## How to Use
1. Run the main Python script or Jupyter Notebook to fetch data, train the model, and visualize predictions.
2. Follow the step-by-step guide in the Notebook to understand the workflow and logic behind each stage of the trading system.

## Model Insights
The trading system's core is a Random Forest Regressor, chosen for its ability to handle non-linear data and provide robust predictions. The model’s performance is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and visualized through matplotlib charts.

## Backtesting Results
The backtesting framework demonstrates the trading strategy's performance over historical data. The results, including portfolio value changes over time, are visually represented in the project.
